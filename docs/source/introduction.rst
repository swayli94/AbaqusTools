Introduction
=====================

AbaqusTools is a comprehensive Python package designed to streamline and automate ABAQUS finite element analysis workflows. This library provides a collection of wrapped utility functions and object-oriented interfaces that make ABAQUS Python scripting more intuitive, efficient, and maintainable.

What is AbaqusTools?
--------------------

ABAQUS is a powerful finite element analysis software widely used in engineering for structural, thermal, and multiphysics simulations. While ABAQUS provides extensive Python scripting capabilities, writing complex automation scripts often requires deep knowledge of its API structure and involves repetitive coding patterns.

AbaqusTools addresses these challenges by providing:

- **High-level wrapper functions** that simplify common ABAQUS operations
- **Object-oriented interfaces** for models, parts, and analysis results
- **Automated workflow management** for repetitive tasks
- **Specialized tools for composite materials** and layup design
- **Intelligent environment detection** that works both within and outside ABAQUS

Key Features
------------

**Model Management**
    Simplified interfaces for creating, modifying, and managing ABAQUS models with intuitive Python classes.

**Part Operations**
    Advanced part creation and manipulation tools with geometric operations and automated mesh generation.

**Composite Material Support**
    Specialized functions for composite layup design, including automated stacking sequence generation following industry best practices.

**Results Processing**
    Streamlined ODB (Output Database) operations for extracting and processing simulation results.

**Batch Processing**
    Tools for parameter studies, optimization workflows, and automated job submission.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**
    Intelligent detection of ABAQUS environment with fallback support for development and testing outside ABAQUS/CAE.

Who Should Use AbaqusTools?
---------------------------

AbaqusTools is designed for:

- **Simulation Engineers** who want to automate repetitive modeling tasks
- **Research Scientists** conducting parameter studies and optimization
- **Composite Engineers** working with laminated materials and complex layup designs
- **CAE Analysts** looking to streamline their ABAQUS workflows
- **Python Developers** building custom simulation tools and applications

Getting Started
--------------

AbaqusTools is designed to work seamlessly with the ``abqpy`` package, which provides comprehensive type hints for ABAQUS Python scripting. This combination allows you to develop ABAQUS automation scripts with full IDE support, code completion, and type checking.

For the best development experience, we recommend installing ``abqpy`` alongside AbaqusTools:

.. code-block:: python

   pip install abqpy

This enables you to write your ABAQUS Python scripts fluently, even without opening ABAQUS/CAE, and provides the ability to build models, submit jobs, and extract output data in a single Python script.

The library automatically detects whether it's running within an ABAQUS environment and imports the appropriate modules accordingly, ensuring compatibility across different usage scenarios.
